Azure Honeypot Monitored with Microsoft Sentinel
Azure Honeypot with Microsoft Sentinel

Overview

Built a Windows honeypot in Azure to detect and log brute-force RDP attacks using Microsoft Sentinel.

This project simulates a real-world attacker environment where malicious activity is logged, monitored, and analyzed through Sentinel using KQL. It demonstrates log ingestion, event analysis, and detection engineering.

KQL Queries Used

Failed Login Detection:

SecurityEvent
| where EventID == 4625
| order by TimeGenerated desc

Brute-Force Detection:

SecurityEvent
| where EventID == 4625
| where LogonType == 10
| summarize FailedAttempts = count() by TargetUserName, bin(TimeGenerated, 5m)
| where FailedAttempts >= 3

Screenshot: docs/screenshots/4625-query-results.png

Manual Traffic Simulation

Used .rdp file to attempt multiple failed logins with wrong passwords

Optional tools used:

nmap -Pn <VM_IP>

hydra -l Administrator -P passlist.txt rdp://<VM_IP>

Detection Rule (Optional)

Name: RDP Brute-Force DetectionKQL:

SecurityEvent
| where EventID == 4625
| where LogonType == 10
| summarize FailedAttempts = count() by TargetUserName, bin(TimeGenerated, 5m)
| where FailedAttempts >= 3

Runs every 5 min

Alerts if results > 0
